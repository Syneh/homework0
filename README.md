Jinshan Pan, a Ph.D. student  School of Mathematical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Merced, directed by Profs.  Zhixun Su and Ming-Hsuan Yang.He was a visiting Ph.D. student in Visual Computing Group at Harvard University, working with Prof. Hanspeter Pfister and Dr. Deqing Sun in 2015.
His research interest includes image deblurring, image/video analysis and enhancement, and related vision problems.  
I choose him to write about because I've studied his severel papers that he used deep learning network to deblur images.
"Learning Fully Convolutional Networks for Iterative Non-blind Deconvolution", arXiv preprint in 2017, is a paper that he introduce a fully convolutional neruel network(FCNN) on denoising to help the convolutional part do better results.
"Learning Recursive Filters for Low-Level Vision via a Hybrid Neural Network", ECCV in 2016, is a paper that use RNN and CNN to learn filters for image denoising.
In the future, I believe that he will propose more papers using deep learning for deblurring, denoising etc. So I will keep folowing him.
